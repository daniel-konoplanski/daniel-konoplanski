# üëã About me

Hi ‚Äî I‚Äôm Daniel Konopla≈Ñski, a passionate Software Engineer with ~5 years of experience. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with an emphasis on Systems Design and Data Analysis. I love tackling complex problems and creating robust, production-grade applications. I also enjoy deepening my knowledge in C++, Python scripting, learning about operating system internals, reverse engineering, performance and memory optimization, and checking how things work under the hood.

## üìÅ Projects

### [bf2_memhack_v2](https://github.com/daniel-konoplanski/bf2_memhack_v2)
bf2_memhack_v2 is an internal cheat for Battlefield 2 and compatible mods like Forgotten Hope 2 and Project Reality. It allows users to toggle features such as player nametags (displaying names and distances above heads), maphack (revealing enemy positions on the minimap), and a simple in-game UI menu for easy control.
