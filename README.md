# About me

Hi — I’m Daniel Konoplański, a passionate Software Engineer with ~5 years of experience. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with an emphasis on Systems Design and Data Analysis. I love tackling complex problems and creating robust, production-grade applications. I also enjoy deepening my knowledge in C++, Python scripting, learning about operating system internals, reverse engineering, performance and memory optimization, and checking how things work under the hood.

## 📁 Projects

### [p2p_ft](https://github.com/daniel-konoplanski/p2p_file_transfer)
A minimal peer-to-peer file transfer tool for Linux written in C++23. It enables direct encrypted file transfers between two machines using TLS 1.2+ with auto-generated ECDSA certificates. The sender streams files in chunks while the receiver gets interactive approval prompts and real-time progress tracking. Built with Boost.Asio, Protocol Buffers, and modern cryptography libraries.


### [bf2_memhack_v2](https://github.com/daniel-konoplanski/bf2_memhack_v2)
bf2_memhack_v2 is an internal cheat for Battlefield 2 and compatible mods like Forgotten Hope 2 and Project Reality. It allows users to toggle features such as player nametags (displaying names and distances above heads), maphack (revealing enemy positions on the minimap), and a simple in-game UI menu for easy control.

### [bitmap_manipulator](https://github.com/daniel-konoplanski/bitmap_manipulator)
bitmap_manipulator is a simple Windows Forms desktop app built in C# using the .NET Framework. It demonstrates four essential image processing filters—grayscale conversion, reflection, blur, and edge detection—allowing users to load, manipulate, and preview images in real-time.
